/**
 * A Response contains a tree representing all of the answers the user has given so far to a
 * {@link Survey}. Answers are stored as a tree of {@link QuestionResponseNode}s joined together by
 * {@link ActionNode}s. Each time the user answers a {@link Question}, a QuestionNode is added to
 * the tree. The QuestionNode contains an array of ActionNodes, one of each {@link Option} the user
 * chose for that question. The ActionNodes link to QuestionNodes for follow-on questions, or to
 * {@link .endNode} at the end of a line of questions.
 *
 * Responses are finished if every question is answered (excluding questions that are not asked
 * because they are outside of the response tree). A response is "effectively finished" when there
 * is no future question that can be asked that would change the final incident level.
 *
 * Response trees can be traversed simultaneously with the corresponding Survey tree using
 * {@link ResponseTraverser}. Responses must always be traversed depth-first, as that is the order
 * used when the user is presented the survey.
